## Overview
This project aims to [brief description of the project objectives and goals]. The main focus is to [describe the main focus, e.g., analyze a specific dataset, build a predictive model, perform data visualization, etc.]. The project leverages various data science techniques including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wiferpagri/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the analysis:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can also explore individual notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to see the step-by-step data processing and analysis.

## Datasets
The data used in this project is sourced from [mention source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. The datasets are stored in the data/ directory:

* `raw/` contains the original, unprocessed data.
* `interim/` contains intermediate data that has been transformed.
* `processed/` contains cleaned and preprocessed data ready for analysis.
* `external/` contains any additional data from external sources.

## Results
The results of the analysis and model performance are documented in the `reports/` directory. This includes:

* Final model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)
* Visualizations and plots
* Detailed analysis reports

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-branch-name.
3. Make your changes and commit them: git commit -m 'Add new feature'.
4. Push to the branch: git push origin feature-branch-name.
5. Create a pull request detailing your changes.
